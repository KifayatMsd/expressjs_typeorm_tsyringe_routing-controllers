# Node.js Starter Project with Express.js, TypeORM, and More!

Welcome to our Node.js starter project that provides a solid foundation for building web applications. This project is built on top of various powerful libraries, carefully selected to streamline your development process and ensure code quality. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with Node.js, our starter project will help you get up and running quickly and efficiently.

## Key Libraries Included

1. **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. With Express.js, you can easily handle routes, middleware, and HTTP requests, allowing you to focus on building robust APIs and web applications.

2. **TypeORM**: An advanced Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript. TypeORM simplifies database interactions by providing a seamless way to manage database connections, schema migrations, and data models.

3. **routing-controllers**: This library makes it straightforward to build RESTful APIs by allowing you to define controllers and actions using decorators. It integrates seamlessly with Express.js, providing a clean and organized way to structure your API routes.

4. **tsyringe**: A lightweight dependency injection container for TypeScript. tsyringe enhances the modularity of your code by facilitating the management and injection of dependencies, making your project easier to maintain and test.

5. **sqlite3**: A self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine. SQLite3 is an excellent choice for development and testing purposes, as it requires minimal setup and offers high performance for local development.

## Features and Benefits

- Quick and easy setup: Our starter project comes pre-configured with all the necessary boilerplate code, allowing you to focus on building features rather than spending time on initial setup.
- Scalable architecture: The project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, making it easy to extend and adapt as your application grows.
- TypeScript support: Leverage the power of TypeScript to catch errors early and improve code maintainability, thanks to strong typing and intellisense.
- Powerful database management: TypeORM and SQLite3 combine to provide a robust database solution, ensuring smooth data storage and retrieval.
- Testability: With tsyringe's dependency injection, testing your components in isolation becomes a breeze, enabling better test coverage and code quality.
